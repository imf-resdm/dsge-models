tau     	\\tau	0.34	intertemporal elasticity of substitution	18	"According to Agenor and Montiel (1999), most estimates of this parameter for LDCs lie between 0.10 and 0.50. The value in the base case, 0.34, equals the average estimate for LICs in Ogaki et al. (1996)."
epsilon 	\\epsilon	0.5	intratemporal elasticity of substitution across goods	"10,11,12,42"	"We fix the elasticity of substitution in comsumption at 0.50 as estimates of compensated elasticities of demand tend to be small at high levels of aggregation, especially when food claims a large share of total consumption."
alpha_n      	\\alpha_{n}	0.55	capital’s share in value added in the non-traded sector	"1,6,8"	"Data on factor shares may be found in social accounting matrices assembled by the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The GTAP5 database for SSA suggests a capital share of 55 - 60% in the non-tradables sector and 35 - 40% in the tradables sector. The data in Thurlow et al. (2004) and Perrault et al. (2010) suggest similar numbers. Accordingly, we set the parameter to 0.55 in the non-traded sector and 0.40 in the traded sector."

xi_n    	\\xi_{n}	0	capital learning externalities (traded sector)	3	"The base case does not incorporate learning externalities. In alternative runs that allow for learning effects, the output learning externalities are set to 0.08 so that the social return to capital in the traded sector is about 30% higher than the private return."

alpha_k 	\\alpha_{k}	0.5	cost share of non-traded inputs in the production of private capital	4	Data on the ratio of imported machinery and equipment to aggregate investment indicate that the cost share parameters are around 0.5 in SSA. One-half is also the guesstimate used by the IMF (2007a) in its analysis of scaling up public investment in Nigeria.
alpha_z 	\\alpha_{z}	0.5	cost share of non-traded inputs in the production of public capital	5	Data on the ratio of imported machinery and equipment to aggregate investment indicate that the cost share parameters are around 0.5 in SSA.

nxpsi   	\\psi_{nx}	1	sectoral output elasticity ratio	"0,1"	"The ratio of sectoral output elasticities is set independently. This ratio and other values assigned elsewhere in calibrating the model -- most notably, the return on infrastructure -- pin down sectoral output elasticity in each sector. We assume that the ratio of elasticities is equal to 1 in all runs."
delta_n 	\\delta_{n}	0.05	depreciation rate of non-traded capital inputs	"15,16,21,22"	There is little hard data on depreciation rates in LICs. Our choice of 5% is in line with estimates for developed countries.

omega   	\\Omega	2	elasticity of investment with respect to tobin's q		"This parameters is the elasticity of investment with respect to Tobin’s q. There are no reliable estimates of this elasticity for LICs. The assigned value, 2, is at the high end of estimates for developed countries. The results do not change substantively when it equals 1 or 10."
fo           	f	0.5	fraction of recurrent costs to user fees for infrastructure	"13,29,33"	"The user fee for infrastructure services is a fixed multiple/fraction of recurrent costs. Fuel taxes, which are earmarked for road maintenance and construction, electricity tariffs, and user charges for water and sanitation are low but not trivial in LICs. According to Briceño-Garmendia et al. (2008), on average, user fees recoup 50% of recurrent costs in SSA. Again, however, there is considerable variation -- Zambia’s average electricity tariff was three cents per kWH in 2008. We decided therefore to let this share vary from 0.20 to unity, setting it to 0.5 in the base case."

eta          	\\eta	1	portfolio adjustment costs parameter	17	The portfolio adjustment cost parameter controls the degree of openness of the capital account. We set it equal to 1 in the base case to capture the fact that the private sector has limited access to international capital markets. We assume that the public risk premium is constant and set equal to zero.
etag    	\\eta_{g}	0	public debt risk premium	30	The portfolio adjustment cost parameter controls the degree of openness of the capital account.
