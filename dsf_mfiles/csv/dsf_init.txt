This is slightly above Gueye and Sy’s (2010) estimate of the average interest rate SSA pays (8.55%) on debt raised in external capital markets, excluding Seychelles and South Africa. The IMF-WB’s DSAs show an average interest rate of 2.3% on concessional loans taken out by LICs in 2009-2010. Assuming 2.5% inflation in world prices of traded goods, the corresponding (initial) real rates in dollars are about 6% for commercial debt and 0% for concessional debt. The latter is assumed to be constant through the analysis."

R_zo 	R_o	0.3	initial return on infrastructure	"0,1"	"Estimates of the return on infrastructure are all over the map, but the weight of the evidence in both micro and macro studies points to a high average return. The median rate of return on World Bank projects circa 2001 was 20% in SSA and 15-29% for various sub-categories of infrastructure investment. Foster and Briceño-Garmendia (2010) estimate returns for electricity, water and sanitation, irrigation, and roads range from 17% to 24%. Similarly, the macro-based estimates in Dalgaard and Hansen (2005) cluster between 15% and 30% for a wide array of different estimators. Hulten  et al. (2006), Escribano et al. (2008), Calderón et al. (2009), and Calderón and Servén (2010) supply additional evidence of high returns. All of this adds up to a presumption that high returns are the norm. We consider a high-return scenario as the base case by setting the return on infrastructure to 0.25 at the initial steady state."
